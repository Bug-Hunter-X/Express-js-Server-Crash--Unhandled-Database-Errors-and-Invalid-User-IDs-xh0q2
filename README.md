# Express.js Server Crash: Unhandled Database Errors and Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  failure to handle database query errors and invalid input gracefully.  The `bug.js` file showcases this issue, resulting in a server crash.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Bug Description

The original code lacks error handling for database queries and for cases where a user ID is invalid. If the database query fails or if an invalid user ID is provided, the server crashes without providing any useful information to the client.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates the proper way to handle these errors.  It includes:

* **Input Validation:** Checks for invalid user IDs.
* **Database Query Error Handling:**  Catches and handles potential errors during database interaction, returning appropriate error messages to the client instead of crashing.
* **Robust Error Responses:** Provides meaningful responses to the client in case of an error, allowing for better user experience and easier debugging.
